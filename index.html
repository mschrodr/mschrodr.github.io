									<h1>Hello!</h1>
									<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my personally built resume website. Currently I'm an All-Source Analyst at the National Ground Intelligence Center located in Charlottesville, VA.
											Since graduating from the University of Montana in 2012, with a B.A. in GIS, my career has often taken me down a path that I never thought possible. Shortly after graduating from 
											Montana with a B.A. in Geography and a certificate in GIS, I enlisted into the U.S. Army Reserves where I gained experience working within a fast passed, team driven environment, 
											while also receiving technical training in radios, computers, and GPS devices. Next, I attended the University of Maryland from 2013 to 2015 where I earned a Masters in GIS and a 
											commission in the U.S. Army Reserves as a Military Intelligence officer. My combined educational experience includes training in spatial analysis, thematic cartography, digital map 
											design, remote sensing, Geomorphology, GIS field techniques, and web programing.</p>
											
											<p>Since graduating from Maryland, I’ve gained experience conducting GIS analysis, data management, field data collection, cartographic design, and web mapping for both environmental 
											and national security related issues. I’ve developed cartographic aids used in informing local governmental officials on the Virginia Department of Transportation’s Chesapeake watershed 
											project, too informing national level leadership on sensitive issues from around the world. For the past three years my experience has shifted more towards balancing my GIS skills with 
											general research and analysis and project management.</p>
											
											<p>On the personal side, my wife currently works as an elementary school music teacher for Richmond Public Schools. On our time off you’ll likely find us and our two dogs blazing through 
											a section of new hiking trails. Using a Garmin GPS and a dedicated google web map to keep track, we’ve hiked over 225 miles of the Appalachian Trail. We’ve mapped a continues stretch from 
											the MD/PA border down past historic Harpers ferry, WV and on through beautiful Shenandoah National park. With a passion for GIS and a love of the outdoors, it would be a honor to work with 
											your team.</p>
											
											<p>After reviewing this website, I hope you will agree that I am the positive and driven candidate that you are looking for. I’m excited to elaborate on how my proven skills and 
											abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me at (240) 409-1632 or via email at <a href="mailto:mattrschroeder@icloud.com" target="_top">mattrschroeder@icloud.com</a> to arrange for a convenient meeting time.</p>
											
											<p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
											<p>Sincerely,<br>
											Matthew Schroeder </p>
