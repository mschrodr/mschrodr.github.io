									<h1>Hello!</h1>
									<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about my background and how I feel I’d make a great addition to your team. I’m a hard-working, hands-on, driven individual with an excellent 
										track record of finishing projects on time, within scope and exciding expected quality.
										</p>
										<p><u>Education:</u> My education experience includes a B.A. in Geography and Certificate in Geospatial Information Science (2012) from the University of Montana and a Masters in Geospatial Information 
										Science from the University of Maryland. Each degree had a unique focus on how GIS can be used to solve the various problem that surround us. At Montana I gained training in spatial analysis, 
										digital cartography, field survey techniques, thematic cartography, and community/regional analysis. While Montana focused on rural areas and forest land management, my training at Maryland often 
										focused on Urban development, programing, and advanced image processing. This included courses in spatial analysis & statistics, database management, GIS modeling, remote sensing, and GIS 
										programing/scripting.</p>
										<p><u>Past Professional Experience:</u> Since graduating from Maryland, I’ve effectively applied my knowledge to conducting GIS analysis, data management, field data collection, cartographic design, and web 
										mapping for both environmental and national security related issues. While at EEE I conducted spatial analysis and developed cartographic aids used to inform local government officials on the Virginia 
										Department of Transportation’s Chesapeake watershed project. This included acquiring and managing GIS data from state, county, and city GIS databases, conducting land cover analysis within parcels, and 
										collecting data in the field. My experience at EEE was followed by work as a Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Analyst at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) where I provided critical and timely 
										geospatial products related to threats posed by WMDs. This primary revolved around using ArcGIS within a fast-paced environment to perform spatial analysis, data management and map creation for use in 
										reports/presentations used to inform senior Military and Government leadership. </p>
										<p><u>Current Professional Experience:</u> Since 2018 I’ve been balancing my GIS skills with those of general research and analysis towards producing infrastructure-centric intelligence at the National Ground 
										Intelligence Center (NGIC) in Charlottesville, Va. This work entails collaborating with a multi-disciplined team of signal, GIS, imagery and cultural analysts to help address complex issues related to 
										foreign infrastructure, capabilities, and trends within the Asia Pacific (INDOPACOM) region. Since October 2020, and after two years of effective projects, I was promoted to Team Lead/Project Manager. 
										This entails leading my own multi-disciplined team of analysts against complex infrastructure related projects. This also includes managing long term technical projects from initiation and close out with 
										multi million dollars in funding. By leading and guiding a group of uniquely specialized analysis it has helped me better understand how one specialty cannot answer a problem effectivity on its own. It 
										takes input from a team with various personal and professional backgrounds to answer a project’s scope. </p>
										<p><u>Military:</u> Outside of school and professional training I also have +10 years as an Army reservist, gaining experience in IT, analysis, and leadership. From 2012 to 2015 I received and applied technical 
										military training related to radios, computers, GPS devices and even ArcGIS. In 2015 I earned a commission as an All-Source Intelligence Officer gaining experience in leadership, analysis, and project management. 
										Currently, I’m an Army Reserve Captain providing All-Source and imagery support to the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) one weekend a month. Starting in June 2022 I will begin providing Geospatial 
										Support to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Throughout my part time military career, I’ve gained extensive experience working within a fast passed, team driven environment that requires managing 
										shifting priorities under high-pressure.</p>
										<p>On the personal side, my wife currently works as an elementary school music teacher for Richmond Public Schools. On our time off you’ll likely find us and our two dogs blazing through a section of new hiking 
										trails. Using a Garmin GPS and a dedicated google web map to keep track, I’ve logged over 225 miles of the Appalachian Trail that we’ve hiked. With a passion for GIS and a love of the outdoors, it’d be an honor 
										to join your team as a geospatial analyst.</p>
											
											<p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
											<p>Sincerely,<br>
											Matthew Schroeder </p>
